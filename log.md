# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0/1: Nov 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** 1. Was occupied for a long time with implementing bfs on grid. Couldn't make it work. Saw a solution on gfg, realized that I wasn't storing the start index before checking for validity. Also, vectorofvectors would be better than a 2D matrix to store visited cells.

2. Learned about variance, covariance & contravariance & played a bit with higher-order functions & lambdas in Kotlin. Started with a dice roller app in the Google Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Today wasn't very satisfactory. I covered some Kotlin theory, & code. But I'd like to be able to code more everyday. The xml part in Android feels difficult, esp the relative positioning of views. I'm not even able to do simple things like rotating a picture & placing caption & date properly on it. I hope as I take guided approach to some apps, it'd then be easier to do things on my own:')

**Link to work:** []() *I'll try to upload the dice roller app tomorrow.

### Day 2: Nov 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** 1. Made submissions to 2 CSES graph problems.
 2. Fiddled with with constraint layout & made a signin page.

**Thoughts:** MOre satisfied than yesterday.

### Day 3: Nov 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** 1. * Tried to solve a CSES bipartite graph problem. Couldn't make it work. It's failing for the test cases which can't be made bipartite.
* Tried Range Sum Queries I. Getting run-time error. I think I'm not taking the input the right way.
2. Levelled up the login app to make it look like the PhonePe app's login. The "Welcome " isn't showing on the phone. Can't figure out why.

**Thoughts:** A little more satisfied than tomorrow, though I'd really want to be more efficient with cp. None of my sulotions passed all the test cases today.

### Day 4: Nov 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Made a dice roller app using the knowledge of how to change text/images dynamically during run time by writing Kotlin code in the MainActivity.kt file.

**Thoughts:** Kotlin code in the ActivityMain.kt file seems easier now. I think some of that might be because I took the time to learn Kotlin before starting the Udacity course. I still didn't do any CP today & hope will do more of it regularly.

### Day 5: Dec 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today was occupied with MainActivity.kt & trying to understand & implement data binding. Made a Wikipedia page clone & used data binding, & tried to add hyperlink. Idk why that isn't working tho.

**Thoughts:** Not very satisfactory. I hope I finish data binding tomorrow, along with some more solid concepts.

### Day 6: Dec 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Gave the Coding Ninjas Test (Internship/Job) 2.0's round 2. Learned about Bezout's Theorem by solving a problem that appeared in the test, along with 2 other graph problems, one full the other partially. Coudldn't solve the last problem based on Generic Tree.

**Thoughts:** Nothing much. Periods. I took the later half of the day off.

### Day 7: Dec 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Built a ColorMyView app, using knowledge of constraint layout & Kotlin code. Worked on a multi source bfs graph problem. Didn't complete.

**Thoughts:** Not v productive, but okay (Goddd I need a break. & see my friend from college!!!).

### Day 11: Dec 8, 2020


**Today's Progress:** Added a drawer menu to a new #F1 app I started working on. The Toolbar variable in the MainActivity is taking a toll on me. Idk what's wrong with it. Kindly share suggestions, if any.

**Thoughts:** I'm lagging behind in Codedamn's accelerated course.

**Link to work:**


### Day 12: Dec 10, 2020


**Today's Progress:** Added few more elements to the drawer menu, & animations to the entry & exit of fragments in the app. Brushed up HTML & CSS fundamentals by practicing on Codedamn. 

**Thoughts:** I'm too distracted for this. Idlk why but there's more to life than code.

**Link to work:** Tomorrow maybe. Connection Android w/ Github is taking a toll on me.
