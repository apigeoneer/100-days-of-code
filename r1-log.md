# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Chitranshi Srivastava]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Nov 27, Friday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
1. Was occupied for a long time with implementing bfs on grid. Couldn't make it work. Saw a solution on gfg, realized that I wasn't storing the start index before checking for validity. Also, vectorofvectors would be better than a 2D matrix to store visited cells.

2. Learned about variance, covariance & contravariance & played a bit with higher-order functions & lambdas in Kotlin. Started with a dice roller app in the Google Udacity course.

### R1D2
1. Made submissions to 2 CSES graph problems. 2. Fiddled with with constraint layout & made a signin page.

### R1D3
1. * Tried to solve a CSES bipartite graph problem. Couldn't make it work. It's failing for the test cases which can't be made bipartite.

Tried Range Sum Queries I. Getting run-time error. I think I'm not taking the input the right way.
Levelled up the login app to make it look like the PhonePe app's login. The "Welcome " isn't showing on the phone. Can't figure out why.

### R1D4
Made a dice roller app using the knowledge of how to change text/images dynamically during run time through the Kotlin code in the MainActivity.kt file.

### R1D5
Today was occupied with MainActivity.kt & trying to understand & implement data binding. Made a Wikipedia page clone & used data binding, & tried to add hyperlink. Idk why that isn't working tho.
